### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arpit, CTO of [Appsmith](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith), the first open source low code platform used to build internal tools used by more than 1000 teams. As a startup veteran, I love solving problems with technology. Occassionally, I share my experiences on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/mohanarpit) and [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@mohanarpit).
